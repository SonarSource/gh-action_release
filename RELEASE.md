# Releasing the Release Action ü§Ø üòµ‚Äçüí´

## TLDR;
To create a release run the [Release workflow](https://github.com/SonarSource/gh-action_release/actions/workflows/release.yml) and approve the Release PR.
The workflow will create the GitHub Release.

## Explanation
Due to the circular dependency issue with GitHub Actions self-reference, the release process is a bit more complex, as described
in [scripts/pull-request-body.txt](./scripts/pull-request-body.txt).

#### Tag and Release

This is available on GitHub: https://github.com/SonarSource/gh-action_release/actions/workflows/release.yml

```bash
scripts/release.sh <branch> <version>
```

This script will:

1. commit references the future tag
2. commit references the previous commit
3. tag this second commit
4. commit references back to the branch
5. generate a PR with those release commits and the release tag
6. the PR should be automatically approved and fast-forward merged
7. create a Release on GitHub

Example:

```
$ scripts/release.sh branch-2 2.0.0
$ git log --graph --pretty="%H %s %d" branch-2 -3 --reverse
* 1c42d553f38c91d92aaff793a67d48d62255f9be chore: update self-references to 2.0.0
* 2082aca0c8aa7cb64320b3713391d3d1056aaec6 chore: update self-references to 1c42d553f38c91d92aaff793a67d48d62255f9be  (tag: 2.0.0)
* 0000554720dc90f987a86a43531b8595f27ea53e chore: update self-references to branch-2  (origin/pull/158, origin/branch-2)
```

#### Update the v* Branch

This is available on GitHub: https://github.com/SonarSource/gh-action_release/actions/workflows/release.yml

```bash
scripts/updatevbranch.sh <version>
```

Example:

```
$ scripts/updatevbranch.sh 2.0.0
$ git show -s --pretty=format:'%H%d' 2.0.0
2082aca0c8aa7cb64320b3713391d3d1056aaec6 (tag: 2.0.0, origin/v2)
```
