# This workflow verifies that for the given sets of inputs/outputs the gh-action_release defined in the current branch (PR)
# still works as expected.
#
# It checks for the current branch, and allows checking of new input/output parameters at the PR time  (Fail fast principles)
# without having to release the action first and then use it in a side project.
