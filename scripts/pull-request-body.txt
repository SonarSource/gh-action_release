DO NOT MERGE with GitHub UI!

This PR:
- MUST be merged before any other PR
- MUST be fast-forward merged (GitHub UI merge features DO NOT WORK)
- will be auto-approved under conditions, but manual approval is still allowed

This PR is used to work around the versioning issue with reusable workflows referencing GitHub Actions in the same repository.
It is creating a commit to reference the future tag, then a commit to reference the previous commit, and finally a commit to revert and
reference the main branch. The tag is created on the second commit.
This way, the circular dependency is broken and the workflow call itself.

CHANGELOG:
